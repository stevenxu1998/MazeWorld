# MazeWorld
Description: 

- Developed a program in python that teaches itself to maximize the expected reward of a user traveling through a maze and minimize the number of steps to reach the final goal/destination
- Implemented four machine learning algorithms (i.e., value iteration, policy iteration, SARSA, and QLearning) that would attempt to accomplish the programâ€™s objective 
- Analyzed and compared the performance of each machine learning algorithm 

The 3 Levels of the Maze are shown below:
