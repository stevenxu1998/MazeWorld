# MazeWorld
Description: 

- Developed a program in python that teaches itself to maximize the expected reward of a user traveling through a maze and minimize the number of steps to reach the final goal/destination
- Implemented four machine learning algorithms (i.e., value iteration, policy iteration, SARSA, and QLearning) that would attempt to accomplish the programâ€™s objective 
- Analyzed and compared the performance of each machine learning algorithm 


The program will simulate the 3 Levels of the Maze which are shown below (level 1-left image, level 2-middle image, level 3-right image):

Red Square - Starting point
Yellow Circle - final destination/goal
Black Square - Walls of the Maze that the user cannot land on
Blue Square - Reward that the user can get during the simulation
