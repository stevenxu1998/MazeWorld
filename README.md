# MazeWorld
Description: 
•	Developed a program in python that teaches itself to maximize the expected reward of a user traveling through a maze and minimize the number of steps to reach the final goal/destination
•	Implemented four machine learning algorithms (i.e., value iteration, policy iteration, SARSA, and QLearning) that would attempt to accomplish the program’s objective 
•	Analyzed and compared the performance of each machine learning algorithm
